# The Cover Band Scene

## Problem
There is a rich community of cover music performers, venues, and music lovers in the mid-atlantic region. But, there's no central home to quickly and easily find "who's playing in Atlantic City this weekend", "who's playing at Parx Casino tonight?", or "what time do The Benderz play tomorrow?". Venue calendars are lazily out of date, band calendars are hidden in the sea of their instagram posts, and no one ever really knows what time the band starts. The main consequence is annoyed fans and lack of attendence at shows. A secondary consequence is a missed SEO opportunity via calendar pages and event pages with structured data.

## MVP Requirements
- Admin should be able to create, update, and delete bands, venues, and events
- Admin should be able to bulk add events
- Authorized clients should be able to read filtered event and venue data
